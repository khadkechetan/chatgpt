As we celebrate Thanksgiving, I want to take a moment to express my gratitude for your unwavering support and understanding during a difficult time in my life. Your empathy and patience meant more to me than words can express.

I’m also deeply thankful for the trust you’ve placed in me. Knowing that I have your confidence and support has been a source of motivation and strength.

Thank you for being not just a wonderful colleague but a truly kind and understanding person. I wish you and your family a joyful and peaceful Thanksgiving!
